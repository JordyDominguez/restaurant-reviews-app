## Run Restaurant Review App Locally

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and you will be able to explore the Restaurant Review App!

## Instructions

Boot up the app and take it for a spin. Navigate through the app and test it's accessibility. Try taking it offline and see how it is still able to be used!


## What to Expect

The Restaurant Review App site opens an app that is optomized for any device. It also uses a Service Worker to cache data and allow the app to be navigated while offline!
